After discussion, we decided to choose the data set about COMPAS Recidivism Racial Bias. We took time to investigate the data, so we found the original source about the data. Then, we did data loading and cleaning. At last, we read the article on Data for Equity Principals and thought about how the data could be applied on our data. And, we wrote several paragraphs about limitations of your analysis and the potential for abuse or misuse of the data.

# Data Loading and Cleaning Update
On COMPAS data:
* Download and put raw data to data folder
* Used dplyr package to select attributes that is useful to our project and get rid of those we don't need
* Convert string date to date object with lubridate package.
* From the date object, calculated each individual's age. This will be helpful later when we start using the second dataset, Iowa Probation Recidivism Status, which has age attribute.
* Then we wrote the cleaned data to data folder.
