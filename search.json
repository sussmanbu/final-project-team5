    "text": "Link To Dataset\nThis dataset was collected by ProPublica in 2013 and 2014 from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida and contains 11,757 individuals’ COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) scores. The COMPAS score is calculated via a computerized algorithm and is a metric commonly used by judges and officers to determine the likelihood of someone re-offending (recidivism). This data was originally collected by ProPublica to analyze and determine the presence of racial biases across the scores.\n\n\n\nWithin the GitHub repository there are several data files. For the purposes of our analysis, we will only be focusing on the compas-scores-raw.csv file which contains the raw data obtained by ProPublica via a public records request. This file contains 28 variables. Of these 28, we have determined that we will be focusing on the following 8:\n\nindividual_ID: The unique identifier for each individual\nSex_Code_Text: Indicates the individual’s sex. We have re-coded this variable to Sex in the cleaned dataset.\nEthnic_Code_Text: Indicates a individual’s ethnicity. Possible values are Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Other, Asian, and African-Am. We have recoded this variable to Race in the cleaned dataset.\nDateOfBirth: Indicates the individual’s date of birth\nAge: The individual’s age, calculated from DOB during data cleaning.\nRawScore: The individual’s raw COMPAS score. This is the raw score generated by the COMPAS algorithm and, in this dataset, ranges from -4.79 to 51.\nDecileScore: The individual’s decile compas score. This score is generated by ranking individuals by their raw scores, dividing this ranked list into ten equal parts (deciles), and assigning a score from 1 to 10 to each individual based on the decile they fall into, effectively categorizing them into relative risk levels.\nScoreText: The individual’s categorized recidivism risk.

This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You’ll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.\nThe audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc.\nWhile the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.\nThe style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I don’t expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind. Avoid using “we” too frequently, for example “We also found that …”. Describe your methodology and your findings but don’t describe your whole process."

This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.\nExplain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)\nDescribe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.\n\nExplain the flaws and limitations of your analysis\n\nAre there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?\n\nClarity Figures\n\nAre your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?\nEach figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)\nDefault lm output and plots are typically not acceptable.\n\nClarity of Explanations\n\nHow well do you explain each figure/result?\nDo you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?\n\nOrganization and cleanliness.\n\nMake sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.\nThis page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data."

The results of the regression model revealed a statistically significant correlation where being classified as African-American was associated with an increase in the decile score by approximately 1.3 points. However, the model’s adjusted R-squared value was 0.06062, indicating that race accounts for only about 6% of the variation in decile scores, suggesting other factors also play a significant role. The accompanying boxplot clearly illustrates higher median scores for African-Americans, indicating a potential systemic trend that would be worth investigating further."

Then, we did data loading and cleaning. At last, we read the article on Data for Equity Principals and thought about how the data could be applied on our data. And, we wrote several paragraphs about limitations of your analysis and the potential for abuse or misuse of the data."

    "section": "Data Equity",
    "text": "Data Equity\nFor the COMPAS Recidivism Racial Bias dataset, equitable data practices are relevant mainly from two points: Beneficence and Transparence. The beneficence principle demands that the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on probation recidivism actively aim to benefit the individuals and communities represented in the data. For this dataset, adhering to beneficence involves being meticulous in how recidivism data are analyzed and presented. This means ensuring that the analysis does not inadvertently stigmatize individuals based on race, ethnicity, or any other demographic characteristic. It also involves considering the potential policy implications of the findings and framing results in a way that highlights systemic solutions rather than individual failings. Transparency is crucial in discussing the dataset’s limitations and the context within which the data were collected and analyzed. Acknowledging the limitations in recidivism research, such as potential biases in the criminal justice system that affect who is under probation and the conditions of their supervision, is essential for responsible use of the data. Transparency about this dataset would involve openly discussing the potential for abuse or misuse of the data, such as the risk of the data being used to support policies that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. It also requires clear communication about the scope of the analysis, the assumptions made, and the measures taken to protect the privacy and dignity of individuals represented in the data. For instance, any analysis should be clear about its geographical and temporal scope, the definitions of success or failure in probation, and the inherent uncertainties in measuring and predicting recidivism. The analysis faces limitations that might not fully capture the complex factors influencing recidivism, such as access to support services and community reintegration programs. Additionally, there could be biases in data collection and reporting processes, reflecting systemic inequalities within the criminal justice system."

The result from Chi-squared test for sex with incarcerated suggests that there is a significant association between an individual’s sex and their likelihood of being reincarcerated. The data would likely show that one sex is more prone to reincarceration than the other. And the result from Chi-squared test for race with incarcerated indicates a significant association between an individual’s race and their likelihood of being reincarcerated. Different races may have different reincarceration rates.\nThe logistic regression analysis on the dataset reveals significant insights into the factors influencing reincarceration rates. “Male”, “White” and “Iowa” are the majority categories in sex, race, and state, and using them as the baseline would provide a point of comparison against the other categories, which can be quite informative, especially in highlighting differences or disproportionalities. The model highlights substantial sex-based differences in reincarceration odds, with females showing significantly lower odds compared to males. Age is another influential factor; younger individuals are more likely to be reincarcerated, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions for youth. Racial disparities are pronounced: American Indians or Alaska Natives exhibit higher reincarceration odds compared to Whites, while Asian or Pacific Islanders and Hispanics have lower odds. Blacks show slightly higher odds than Whites, highlighting nuanced differences among racial groups. Additionally, regional variations are evident, as individuals from Florida are significantly more likely to be reincarcerated than those from Iowa. The model’s excellent fit, as indicated by AIC and changes in deviance, suggests that it effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

We analyzed the distribution of two important variable in our dataset which is “Raw Score” and the “Decile Score”. The “Raw Score” is the original score of individual’s likelyhood to conduct recidivism. The higher the score reflects that the person has a greater chance to reoffend. The “Decile Score” is the score calculated based on the commercial algorithm COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions). COMPAS scores for each defendant ranged from 1 to 10, with ten being the highest risk. Scores 1 to 4 were labeled by COMPAS as “Low”; 5 to 7 were labeled “Medium”; and 8 to 10 were labeled “High.”"

    "text": "Data Background\nThis dataset is collected by ProPublica in 2013 and 2014, from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. COMPAS is biased in favor of white defendants, and against black inmates. We are able to find the data from the original source.\nThere are no issues we can see with how the data was collected. The sample population is from criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida. Moreover, there exists some outliers, which will make the sample biased.\nThe data can be used to analyze the COMPAS recidivism algorithm. Also, the research “machine bias” is based on the same data. This data is used for some policy decisions. The COMPAS tool has been used by judges and parole officers to assess the likelihood of a defendant re-offending. Others asked whether the COMPAS algorithm exhibit racial bias in its predictions."

The median value is slightly above zero, and there is a notable presence of high outliers, indicating that some scores are significantly higher than the majority. The spread of scores within the interquartile range is large, pointing to a substantial dispersion among the middle 50% of data points. In contrast, there are no outliers on the lower side, which suggests that the lower scores are more closely packed together without extreme low values.\nOn the other hand, the box plot for the Decile Scores presents a more symmetrical distribution, with a median value around the midpoint of the score range. This plot is characterized by a narrower interquartile range, indicating less variation among the central half of the scores compared to the Raw Scores. The absence of significant outliers in the Decile Score distribution suggests a more uniform scoring scale, possibly indicating a methodical categorization into deciles. This could reflect a normalizing process, which aims to distribute the scores more evenly across a predetermined scale."

    "text": "Data Set 1: COMPAS Recidivism Racial Bias\nDataset link here\nDescription here\nThis dataset is collected by ProPublica in 2013 and 2014, from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. Dataset consists of 11,757 individuals’ COMPAS(Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) score, which is a popular metric used by judges and officers to determine the likelihood of someone reoffending (recidivism). The data consists of RawScore, DecileScore and ScoreText that tells us about an individual’s COMPAS score. Each record also consists of individual’s sex, race, legal status, supervision level status, which are valuable information for our analysis on the racial difference and sex difference on the bias in COMPAS score used by judicial world.\n\n\nData Set 2: Iowa Probation Recidivism Status\nThis dataset contains deidentified case level records of individuals starting probation supervision in the community. Data begins with the FY 2016 cohort. It also provides an individual’s status at three years to assess whether probation was successful or whether the individual was reincarcerated. The dataset appears to detail recidivism among individuals released from prison, focusing on various demographic, legal, and post-release supervisory characteristics. The following are the definition on main variables in each column:\n\nRace: The individual’s race or ethnicity.\nSex: The individual’s biological sex.\nAge: The individual’s age at start of probation.\nCohort Fiscal Year: The fiscal year the individual began probation. The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30, and is labeled for the calendar year that it ends.\nReport Fiscal Year: The fiscal year in which probation is deemed successful. The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30, and is labeled for the calendar year that it ends.\nSupervision Start Date: Start date of supervision, or earliest start date of concurrent or overlapping sentences.\nSupervision End Date: End date of supervision, or latest end date of concurrent or overlapping sentences.\nPrison Supervision Start Date: Start date of prison supervision where the individual was incarcerated. Null if the individual was not incarcerated.\nPrison Supervision End Date: End date of prison supervision where the individual was incarcerated. Null if the individual was not incarcerated.\nOffense Date: The date of the offense resulting in the individual’s incarceration. Null where the individual was not incarcerated.\nSurvival Time (Days): Provides the number of days the individual was in the community before being incarcerated. Null where the individual was not incarcerated.\nSurvival Time (Months): Provides the number of months (days/30) the individual was in the community before being incarcerated. Null where the individual was not incarcerated.\nSupervision Level: Supervision level assigned to the individual. Options include Levels 1-5. Level 0 indicates risk assessment has not been conducted for the individual.\n\nThe dataset is in a csv file, so it is able to load and clean. From the dataset, we want to explore on the question that are there disparities in recidivism rates among racial-ethnic groups when considering the supervising district?\n\n\nData Set 3: IPUMS CPS COVID-19 Economic Impact Data\nDataset link here\nThis is a cross sectional dataset of data collected from the International Public Use Microdata Supplement’s current population survey. There are a plethora of both person and household level variables to choose from but we have decided to focus on the covid related and demographic variables for the purposes of our analysis.\nThe variables are as follows:\n\nCOVIDTELEW: Indicates if the respondent worked remotely for pay due to COVID-19\nCOVIDUNAW: Indicates if the respondent was unable to work due to COVID-19\nCOVIDPAID: Indicates if the respondent recieved pay for hours not worked due to COVID-19\nCOVIDLOOK: Indicates if COVID-19 prevented the respondent from looking for work\nCOVIDMED: Indicates if the respondent was unable to get needed medical care for a condition other can COVID-19 due to COVID-19\nRACE: The respondents race\n\nFrom IPUMS we were able to obtain a csv file containing data from monthly samples between May 2020 and September 2022. After successfully loading the data into R, the row count indicates that there are 3,035,625 observations in the dataset. With this data, we plan to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on economic stability among different racial groups. Thus, the main question is among different racial groups, which were those most disproportionately affected? Also, the challenge is incomplete data or missing values, which can skew results and lead to inaccurate conclusions. Ensuring data quality and completeness is a significant challenge."
