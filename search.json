    "text": "Link To Dataset\nThe dataset was obtained through a public records request from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida and analyzed by ProPublica. It includes COMPAS scores and relevant components utilized in score calculations. ProPublica enhanced the dataset by matching these scores with public criminal records, based on individual names and birthdates. Recidivism was defined according to Northpointe’s criteria, considering new criminal offenses committed within two years post-COMPAS assessment. Analytical methods applied include logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, aiming to evaluate the influence of various factors on scores and to compare predicted against actual recidivism rates.\n\n\n\nFocus is placed on the compas-scores-raw.csv file from the GitHub repository, featuring 28 variables. Of these, eight are prioritized for analysis: individual_ID, Sex_Code_Text, Ethnic_Code_Text, DateOfBirth, Age, RawScore, DecileScore, and ScoreText. Variables have been recoded for clarity in subsequent analyses.\n\nindividual_ID: The unique identifier for each individual\nSex_Code_Text: Indicates the individual’s sex. We have re-coded this variable to Sex in the cleaned dataset.\nEthnic_Code_Text: Indicates a individual’s ethnicity. Possible values are Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Other, Asian, and African-Am. We have recoded this variable to Race in the cleaned dataset.\nDateOfBirth: Indicates the individual’s date of birth\nAge: The individual’s age, calculated from DOB during data cleaning.\nRawScore: The individual’s raw COMPAS score. This is the raw score generated by the COMPAS algorithm and, in this dataset, ranges from -4.79 to 51.\nDecileScore: The individual’s decile compas score. This score is generated by ranking individuals by their raw scores, dividing this ranked list into ten equal parts (deciles), and assigning a score from 1 to 10 to each individual based on the decile they fall into, effectively categorizing them into relative risk levels.\nScoreText: The individual’s categorized recidivism risk.

    "text": "Modeling and Inference\n\nJustice or Prejudice?\nOne of the most pressing concerns surrounding the COMPAS score is the potential for bias against certain demographic groups, which could perpetuate systemic discrimination and exacerbate existing disparities within the criminal justice system. The analysis uncovered troubling evidence of such biases within the dataset.\nThe distribution of DecileScores, which represent normalized COMPAS scores ranging from 0 (lowest risk) to 10 (highest risk), across racial groups reveals stark disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this figure illustrates, African-Americans tend to have significantly higher median decile scores compared to other races like Caucasian or Asian. In addition, African-American is one of the only 2 minority group that does NOT have the highest score (10) as the outlier, with the other one being Native American.\nThis distribution raises grave concerns about the fairness and equity of the COMPAS algorithm. If individuals from particular racial backgrounds are systematically labeled as higher-risk offenders, it could lead to harsher sentencing decisions, increased rates of incarceration, and a perpetuation of the vicious cycle of marginalization and recidivism.\nFurther examination of the reincarceration rates by sex and race raises additional concerns about the fairness and accuracy of the COMPAS algorithm. The analysis revealed that the majority of individuals, regardless of their demographic characteristics, did not reoffend or become reincarcerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis finding calls into question the validity of assigning high-risk scores to a substantial portion of the population, as it may lead to undue consequences and perpetuate cycles of marginalization. Specifically, for only the violent cases in the Florida dataset, individuals labeled as “high” risk by the COMPAS algorithm (decile scores of 8-10) had a reoffense rate of only 46.69%. Meanwhile, those classified as “medium” risk (decile scores of 5-7) had a reoffense rate of 27.23%. These figures raise concerns about the high-risk threshold set by the COMPAS tool, as a 46.69% reoffense rate for the “high” risk group may not justify the potential consequences associated with such a label, particularly when considering the low overall reincarceration rates observed in our data.\nThe concerning disparities shown in the distribution of COMPAS scores naturally raise questions about the validity and accuracy of the algorithm’s risk predictions. While the disproportionately higher risk assignments for certain minority groups are undoubtedly problematic from a fairness perspective, an equally crucial inquiry is whether these scores align with actual recidivism outcomes. Do the COMPAS scores effectively capture the ground truth of an individual’s likelihood of reoffending, or are they plagued by systematic biases that perpetuate existing prejudices? To address this critical question, the analysis turns to a direct comparison between the COMPAS risk predictions and the observed reoffending rates across different racial groups.\n\n\nGround Truth vs. Prediction\nTo further assess the COMPAS algorithm’s performance and potential biases, a predictive model was developed using the combined data from both Florida and Iowa. The approach involved building a logistic regression model that predicted the binary outcome of reincarceration based on predictor variables such as sex, age, race, and state. The model was trained by setting the reference levels for categorical variables (sex, race, and state) to the categories with the most data points (Male, White, and Iowa, respectively).\nThe model’s performance was evaluated using the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, as shown in the image. The area under the curve (AUC) of 0.6106 indicates a moderate level of predictive performance, albeit with room for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the model’s predictions, the coefficients for each predictor variable were examined. According to the model, factors such as being American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, or from the state of Florida were associated with higher probabilities of reincarceration compared to the respective reference categories (White and Iowa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      log(OR)1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n        Male\n—\n—\n\n        Female\n-0.70\n-0.75, -0.64\n\n        Unknown\n-9.1\n\n\n    age\n-0.01\n-0.02, -0.01\n&lt;0.001\n    race\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n        White\n—\n—\n\n        American Indian or Alaska Native\n0.74\n0.59, 0.90\n\n        Asian or Pacific Islander\n-0.57\n-0.79, -0.37\n\n        Black\n0.31\n0.25, 0.36\n\n        Hispanic\n-0.34\n-0.43, -0.24\n\n        Other\n-0.62\n-0.95, -0.32\n\n    state\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n        Iowa\n—\n—\n\n        Florida\n0.60\n0.52, 0.67\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that these findings contrast with the racial biases observed in the COMPAS scores. While the COMPAS scores exhibited a clear bias against African-Americans, the model and the ground truth data both suggested that American Indian or Alaska Native individuals had the highest likelihood of reoffending, followed by African-Americans. This highlights the divergent patterns of bias present in the COMPAS algorithm compared to the observed recidivism rates in the analysis.\nFurthermore, examination of the proportion of different races that reoffended in each state revealed that Black individuals were not the most likely to reoffend in either Florida or Iowa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results underscore the importance of critically evaluating and calibrating risk assessment tools like COMPAS to ensure that they accurately reflect real-world patterns and do not perpetuate or amplify existing biases against certain racial or ethnic groups. The findings highlight the complex interplay of factors that influence recidivism rates and the potential for data-driven models to exhibit biases or inaccuracies if not carefully constructed and validated. While the model captures some underlying patterns, it is crucial to acknowledge that historical data on recidivism rates should not be blindly extrapolated to make sweeping generalizations about entire racial or ethnic groups. Just because certain groups may have higher observed reoffending rates in the past does not justify assigning elevated risk scores or harsher sentences to all individuals from those backgrounds. Such an approach would only perpetuate cycles of systemic discrimination and undermine the principles of equal justice under the law.\nThe analysis underscores the need for a more nuanced and individualized approach to risk assessment, one that accounts for the multitude of factors that influence an individual’s likelihood of reoffending. While data-driven models can provide valuable insights, they must be carefully calibrated, validated, and complemented with human judgment and a deep understanding of the underlying societal dynamics at play. Furthermore, ongoing efforts to address systemic biases, improve data quality, and explore alternative modeling approaches are crucial for developing more equitable and effective risk assessment tools."

    "text": "Data Set 1: COMPAS Recidivism Racial Bias\nDataset link here\nDescription here\nThis dataset is collected by ProPublica in 2013 and 2014, from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. Dataset consists of 11,757 individuals’ COMPAS(Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) score, which is a popular metric used by judges and officers to determine the likelihood of someone reoffending (recidivism). The data consists of RawScore, DecileScore and ScoreText that tells us about an individual’s COMPAS score. Each record also consists of individual’s sex, race, legal status, supervision level status, which are valuable information for our analysis on the racial difference and sex difference on the bias in COMPAS score used by judicial world.\n\n\nData Set 2: Iowa Probation Recidivism Status\nThis dataset contains deidentified case level records of individuals starting probation supervision in the community. Data begins with the FY 2016 cohort. It also provides an individual’s status at three years to assess whether probation was successful or whether the individual was reincarcerated. The dataset appears to detail recidivism among individuals released from prison, focusing on various demographic, legal, and post-release supervisory characteristics. The following are the definition on main variables in each column:\n\nRace: The individual’s race or ethnicity.\nSex: The individual’s biological sex.\nAge: The individual’s age at start of probation.\nCohort Fiscal Year: The fiscal year the individual began probation. The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30, and is labeled for the calendar year that it ends.\nReport Fiscal Year: The fiscal year in which probation is deemed successful. The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30, and is labeled for the calendar year that it ends.\nSupervision Start Date: Start date of supervision, or earliest start date of concurrent or overlapping sentences.\nSupervision End Date: End date of supervision, or latest end date of concurrent or overlapping sentences.\nPrison Supervision Start Date: Start date of prison supervision where the individual was incarcerated. Null if the individual was not incarcerated.\nPrison Supervision End Date: End date of prison supervision where the individual was incarcerated. Null if the individual was not incarcerated.\nOffense Date: The date of the offense resulting in the individual’s incarceration. Null where the individual was not incarcerated.\nSurvival Time (Days): Provides the number of days the individual was in the community before being incarcerated. Null where the individual was not incarcerated.\nSurvival Time (Months): Provides the number of months (days/30) the individual was in the community before being incarcerated. Null where the individual was not incarcerated.\nSupervision Level: Supervision level assigned to the individual. Options include Levels 1-5. Level 0 indicates risk assessment has not been conducted for the individual.\n\nThe dataset is in a csv file, so it is able to load and clean. From the dataset, we want to explore on the question that are there disparities in recidivism rates among racial-ethnic groups when considering the supervising district?\n\n\nData Set 3: IPUMS CPS COVID-19 Economic Impact Data\nDataset link here\nThis is a cross sectional dataset of data collected from the International Public Use Microdata Supplement’s current population survey. There are a plethora of both person and household level variables to choose from but we have decided to focus on the covid related and demographic variables for the purposes of our analysis.\nThe variables are as follows:\n\nCOVIDTELEW: Indicates if the respondent worked remotely for pay due to COVID-19\nCOVIDUNAW: Indicates if the respondent was unable to work due to COVID-19\nCOVIDPAID: Indicates if the respondent recieved pay for hours not worked due to COVID-19\nCOVIDLOOK: Indicates if COVID-19 prevented the respondent from looking for work\nCOVIDMED: Indicates if the respondent was unable to get needed medical care for a condition other can COVID-19 due to COVID-19\nRACE: The respondents race\n\nFrom IPUMS we were able to obtain a csv file containing data from monthly samples between May 2020 and September 2022. After successfully loading the data into R, the row count indicates that there are 3,035,625 observations in the dataset. With this data, we plan to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on economic stability among different racial groups. Thus, the main question is among different racial groups, which were those most disproportionately affected? Also, the challenge is incomplete data or missing values, which can skew results and lead to inaccurate conclusions. Ensuring data quality and completeness is a significant challenge."

    "text": "The ROC curve’s shape indicates that our logistic regression model has a good capability to discriminate between those individuals who were reincarcerated and those who were not. The curve’s bow toward the top-left corner of the plot suggests that the model performs better than random chance at distinguishing between the two outcomes across a range of thresholds. And the AUC value of 0.6106, while above the threshold of 0.5, indicates that the model’s discriminative ability is moderate.\nThe logistic regression models for Florida and Iowa reveal that sex and age are significant predictors of reincarceration in both states, with females having lower odds and younger individuals higher odds of reincarceration compared to males and older individuals, respectively. However, the influence of race varies between the states; in Florida, being Black significantly increases the odds of reincarceration, while in Iowa, this effect is present but to a lesser degree, and being Asian or Pacific Islander actually lowers the odds, a distinction not observed in Florida. Hispanic individuals have lower odds of reincarceration in Iowa, but this is not significant in Florida. These disparities underscore the need for state-specific criminal justice policies that address the unique sociodemographic factors influencing reincarceration in each state.\nTo further analyze on the difference in the recidivism of different racial groups between the two state, we generated a bar chart. The bar graph depicting reoffense rates by race in Iowa and Florida reveals notable disparities. In Iowa, the American Indian or Alaska Native group shows the highest reoffense proportion, surpassing that of Black individuals, who conversely represent the highest proportion in Florida. The reoffense rate for Black individuals in Florida is markedly elevated compared to that in Iowa. Hispanic and Other racial groups in both states reoffend at lower rates than the Black population, with relatively small differences between these groups across the states. The White and Asian or Pacific Islander populations have the lowest reoffense proportions in both states, with the latter group showing a slightly higher proportion in Florida than in Iowa. This variation in reoffense rates highlights the influence of racial and geographic factors on recidivism and suggests the need for tailored approaches to effectively reduce reoffending within diverse communities."

The result from Chi-squared test for sex with incarcerated suggests that there is a significant association between an individual’s sex and their likelihood of being reincarcerated. The data would likely show that one sex is more prone to reincarceration than the other. And the result from Chi-squared test for race with incarcerated indicates a significant association between an individual’s race and their likelihood of being reincarcerated. Different races may have different reincarceration rates.\nThe logistic regression analysis on the dataset reveals significant insights into the factors influencing reincarceration rates. “Male”, “White” and “Iowa” are the majority categories in sex, race, and state, and using them as the baseline would provide a point of comparison against the other categories, which can be quite informative, especially in highlighting differences or disproportionalities. The model highlights substantial sex-based differences in reincarceration odds, with females showing significantly lower odds compared to males. Age is another influential factor; younger individuals are more likely to be reincarcerated, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions for youth. Racial disparities are pronounced: American Indians or Alaska Natives exhibit higher reincarceration odds compared to Whites, while Asian or Pacific Islanders and Hispanics have lower odds. Blacks show slightly higher odds than Whites, highlighting nuanced differences among racial groups. Additionally, regional variations are evident, as individuals from Florida are significantly more likely to be reincarcerated than those from Iowa. The model’s excellent fit, as indicated by AIC and changes in deviance, suggests that it effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "In this week, we spent some extra time investigating the original data source, and summarized on the data background. We further analyzed on the data in our dataset. We analyzed the distribution of two important variable in our dataset which is “Raw Score” and the “Decile Score”. The “Raw Score” is the original score of individual’s likelyhood to conduct recidivism. The higher the score reflects that the person has a greater chance to reoffend. The “Decile Score” is the score calculated based on the commercial algorithm COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions). COMPAS scores for each defendant ranged from 1 to 10, with ten being the highest risk. Scores 1 to 4 were labeled by COMPAS as “Low”; 5 to 7 were labeled “Medium”; and 8 to 10 were labeled “High.”"

COMPAS is biased in favor of white defendants, and against black inmates. We are able to find the data from the original source.\nThere are no issues we can see with how the data was collected. The sample population is from criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida. Moreover, there exists some outliers, which will make the sample biased.\nThe data can be used to analyze the COMPAS recidivism algorithm. Also, the research “machine bias” is based on the same data. This data is used for some policy decisions. The COMPAS tool has been used by judges and parole officers to assess the likelihood of a defendant re-offending. Others asked whether the COMPAS algorithm exhibit racial bias in its predictions."

The median value is slightly above zero, and there is a notable presence of high outliers, indicating that some scores are significantly higher than the majority. The spread of scores within the interquartile range is large, pointing to a substantial dispersion among the middle 50% of data points. In contrast, there are no outliers on the lower side, which suggests that the lower scores are more closely packed together without extreme low values.\nOn the other hand, the box plot for the Decile Scores presents a more symmetrical distribution, with a median value around the midpoint of the score range. This plot is characterized by a narrower interquartile range, indicating less variation among the central half of the scores compared to the Raw Scores. The absence of significant outliers in the Decile Score distribution suggests a more uniform scoring scale, possibly indicating a methodical categorization into deciles. This could reflect a normalizing process, which aims to distribute the scores more evenly across a predetermined scale."

    "section": "Data Equity",
    "text": "Data Equity\nFor the COMPAS Recidivism Racial Bias dataset, equitable data practices are relevant mainly from two points: Beneficence and Transparence. The beneficence principle demands that the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on probation recidivism actively aim to benefit the individuals and communities represented in the data. For this dataset, adhering to beneficence involves being meticulous in how recidivism data are analyzed and presented. This means ensuring that the analysis does not inadvertently stigmatize individuals based on race, ethnicity, or any other demographic characteristic. It also involves considering the potential policy implications of the findings and framing results in a way that highlights systemic solutions rather than individual failings. Transparency is crucial in discussing the dataset’s limitations and the context within which the data were collected and analyzed. Acknowledging the limitations in recidivism research, such as potential biases in the criminal justice system that affect who is under probation and the conditions of their supervision, is essential for responsible use of the data. Transparency about this dataset would involve openly discussing the potential for abuse or misuse of the data, such as the risk of the data being used to support policies that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. It also requires clear communication about the scope of the analysis, the assumptions made, and the measures taken to protect the privacy and dignity of individuals represented in the data. For instance, any analysis should be clear about its geographical and temporal scope, the definitions of success or failure in probation, and the inherent uncertainties in measuring and predicting recidivism. The analysis faces limitations that might not fully capture the complex factors influencing recidivism, such as access to support services and community reintegration programs. Additionally, there could be biases in data collection and reporting processes, reflecting systemic inequalities within the criminal justice system."

The results of the regression model revealed a statistically significant correlation where being classified as African-American was associated with an increase in the decile score by approximately 1.3 points. However, the model’s adjusted R-squared value was 0.06062, indicating that race accounts for only about 6% of the variation in decile scores, suggesting other factors also play a significant role. The accompanying boxplot clearly illustrates higher median scores for African-Americans, indicating a potential systemic trend that would be worth investigating further."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The use of algorithmic scoring in criminal justice, specifically the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) score, has been touted as a way to modernize and streamline sentencing processes. This score is meant to predict the likelihood that an individual will reoffend. However, beneath the digital facade, concerns about bias and fairness persist. Our exploration of the relationship between demographics and COMPAS score provides insights into how these scores correlate with age, sex, and race, highlighting potential biases that could influence judicial decisions and outcomes."

    "text": "Sex and Race Under the Microscope\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s examine how decile scores distribute across different genders and races. The above figure indicates a generally similar median score for both males and females, though males display a slightly wider range in scores. This could imply a greater variance in how men are assessed, potentially impacting their legal outcomes more diversely than women.\n\n\n\n\n\nRace, however, tells a more concerning story. The distribution of scores by race reveals that African Americans typically receive higher decile scores compared to other races, hinting at a racial bias embedded within the scoring algorithm. This finding raises crucial ethical questions about the deployment of tools such as COMPAS in a justice system that should be blind to color."

Younger individuals tend to have higher scores, which gradually decrease with age. This trend is consistent across all racial groups but is more pronounced in some than others, suggesting that age-related biases could intersect with racial biases to compound the effects of an already flawed system."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWhat does this mean for justice? Our analysis highlights potential disparities in how COMPAS scores are assigned, with troubling implications for fairness and equality in criminal sentencing. These biases could lead to harsher sentencing and higher bail amounts for demographic groups that are already disproportionately affected by the justice system.\nAs we reflect on these findings, it becomes clear that reliance on such algorithmic assessments without ongoing scrutiny and adjustment perpetuates existing societal inequalities under the guise of objectivity. The path forward must involve transparent, inclusive discussions about the role of technology in justice—a dialogue that prioritizes fairness over efficiency."

The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor’s approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture? Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!\n\n\n\nVideo Recording\nMake a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components. You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
